# Guide for the reviewer :
* Embeddings_GloVe contains the notebook for task 2A and the glove embeddings csv file for a few simple words.
* Task2B_soln contains the solution notebook to translate sentences from english to french, since this seems applicable for a machine translating question and answer system.
* Task2B_soln also contains a readme file mentioning the methodology and bugs in the notebook.

# Thanks!
I had a wonderful time working on the WEC recruitments, though my area of interest is Computer vision and I lack experience in the field of regression and NLP I genuinely had a great time working on these tasks.
